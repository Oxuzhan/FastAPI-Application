# FastAPI Application
## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Python 3.10 
-   [Install](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) Docker

## Part 1: Import the datas 
- Make sure you import all necessary libraries using pip in the terminal 
- Make sure you have enviroment
- Run datas.ipynb file
- Take all datas data.json successfully
- You can check total companies with test.ipynb ( Not necessary )

## Part 2: API connection with port and clustering
- Make sure make the connections 
```
pip install celery
celery -A celery1 worker --loglevel=info

```
pip install redis
ps aux | grep redis
